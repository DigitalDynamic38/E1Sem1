3-Point Starter – Summary Points

1. Necessity of Starter

At starting, no back emf → motor draws very high armature current (Ia = V/Ra).

This can damage armature, commutator, and cause large voltage drop.

To limit starting current, a variable resistance (starting resistance) is inserted in series with armature.



2. Construction (3 points: L, F, A)

L (Line): Connected to supply positive.

F (Field): Connected to shunt field winding.

A (Armature): Connected to armature circuit in series with starting resistance.

Contains Starting Resistance, No-Volt Release Coil, Overload Release Coil, and a spring-loaded Starting Handle.



3. Operation

Handle moved from OFF → ON position, progressively cutting out starting resistance in steps.

At ON, handle is held magnetically by No-Volt Release Coil (energized by shunt field current).

If supply fails or field circuit opens → coil de-energises, spring pulls handle to OFF (motor disconnects).

If motor overloads → overload coil attracts armature, short-circuits no-volt coil → handle released to OFF, disconnecting motor.
