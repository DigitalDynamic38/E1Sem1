🧩 Basic Pointer Concepts

1. Q: What is a pointer in C?
A: A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.🥰️


2. Q: How do you declare a pointer in C?
A: int *p; declares a pointer to an integer.🥰️


3. Q: What is the difference between a variable and a pointer?
A: A variable stores a value, while a pointer stores the address of that value.🥰️


4. Q: What does the * operator mean in pointers?
A: It is the dereference operator, used to access the value stored at the address held by the pointer.


5. Q: What does the & operator do?
A: It gives the memory address of a variable.


6. Q: How do you assign the address of a variable to a pointer?
A: p = &x; assigns the address of x to pointer p.


7. Q: What is the output of this code?

int x = 10;
int *p = &x;
printf("%d", *p);

A: Output is 10.


8. Q: Can a pointer be initialized to NULL?
A: Yes, int *p = NULL; means the pointer points to nothing.


9. Q: What happens if you dereference a NULL pointer?
A: It causes a runtime error (segmentation fault).


10. Q: What is a dangling pointer?
A: A pointer pointing to a memory location that has been freed or is no longer valid.

🔁 Intermediate Pointer Logic

11. Q: Can we have a pointer to a pointer?
A: Yes. Example: int **pp; — a pointer storing the address of another pointer.


12. Q: What is the use of a double pointer?
A: Useful for dynamic memory allocation, passing pointer references to functions, or working with arrays of strings.


13. Q: What is a void pointer?
A: A generic pointer that can point to any data type: void *ptr;.


14. Q: Can you perform arithmetic on void pointers?
A: No, because the compiler doesn’t know the size of the data type it points to.❤️‍🔥️


15. Q: What is pointer arithmetic?
A: Operations like p++ or p-- that move the pointer to the next or previous memory location of its data type.


16. Q: If p is an int *, what does p + 1 mean?
A: It moves the pointer to the next integer location (usually +4 bytes).


17. Q: What is the difference between p and *p?
A: p is the address; *p is the value stored at that address.


18. Q: Can two pointers point to the same variable?
A: Yes, multiple pointers can store the same address.
	except in strings.

19. Q: What will this print?

int a = 5, *p1, *p2;
p1 = &a;
p2 = p1;
printf("%d", *p2);

A: Output is 5.


20. Q: What happens if you increment a pointer to an array?
A: It points to the next element of the array.

🧠 Pointers and Arrays

21. Q: How are arrays and pointers related?
A: ❤️‍🔥️The array name acts as a pointer to its first element.


22. Q: What is the difference between a and &a for an array?
A: ❤️‍🔥️a is a pointer to the first element; &a is a pointer to the entire array.


23. Q: What is the output?

int a[3] = {10, 20, 30};
int *p = a;
printf("%d", *(p + 1));

A: Output is 20.


24. Q: Can you change the address stored in an array name?
A: No, array names are constant pointers.❤️‍🔥️


25. Q: How can you access array elements using pointers?
A: Using pointer arithmetic: *(a + i) is equivalent to a[i].❤️‍🔥️


26. Q: What is the difference between *a + 1 and *(a + 1)?
A: *a + 1 adds 1 to the first element; *(a + 1) accesses the second element.


27. Q: What does a[i] actually mean internally?
A: It is equivalent to *(a + i).


28. Q: How do you pass an array to a function using a pointer?
A: void func(int *arr) or void func(int arr[]) — both are equivalent.


29. Q: What is the output?

int arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};
int *p = arr;
printf("%d", ++*p);

A: Output is 2 (increments the first element).


30. Q: Can you have an array of pointers?
A: Yes, e.g. int *arr[3]; — stores addresses of integer variables.

⚙️ Pointers and Functions

31. Q: Why do we use pointers in function arguments?
A: To allow functions to modify the actual variable values (pass-by-reference).


32. Q: What is the difference between call by value and call by reference?
A: Call by value passes a copy; call by reference passes the address.


33. Q: Example of swapping two numbers using pointers?
A:

void swap(int *x, int *y) {
    int temp = *x;
    *x = *y;
    *y = temp;
}


34. Q: What is a function pointer?
A: A pointer that stores the address of a function.


35. Q: Syntax of declaring a function pointer?
A: int (*fptr)(int, int);


36. Q: How do you call a function using a function pointer?
A: (*fptr)(a, b); or fptr(a, b);


37. Q: What is the use of function pointers?
A: Used for callbacks, dynamic function calling, and event handling.


38. Q: Can a function return a pointer?
A: Yes, e.g. int* getPointer() { return &x; }


39. Q: Why must we be careful when returning pointers from functions?
A: Never return a pointer to a local variable — it becomes invalid after function exits.


40. Q: What is a pointer to a function pointer?
A: A higher-level pointer that stores the address of a function pointer — rarely used.

💡 Advanced & Logical Questions

41. Q: What is pointer typecasting?
A: Converting one pointer type to another using casting, e.g. (float *)ptr.


42. Q: Can we assign one type of pointer to another?
A: Only with explicit casting, otherwise it’s unsafe.


43. Q: What are wild pointers?
A: Pointers that are declared but not initialized — they point to unknown memory.


44. Q: How can wild pointers be avoided?
A: Always initialize pointers to NULL or a valid address.


45. Q: What is memory leak in pointer context?
A: When dynamically allocated memory is not freed, leading to wasted memory.


46. Q: What is the purpose of malloc()?
A: To allocate memory dynamically at runtime.


47. Q: What is the difference between malloc() and calloc()?
A: malloc() allocates uninitialized memory; calloc() allocates and initializes it to zero.


48. Q: What does free() do?
A: Deallocates memory previously allocated by malloc() or calloc().


49. Q: What happens if you free the same pointer twice?
A: It leads to undefined behavior or program crash.


50. Q: Can we use pointers to access structures?
A: Yes, using the arrow operator (->) like ptr->member
